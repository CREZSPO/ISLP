    "\n",
    "   __(a)__ Provide a sketch of typical (squared) bias, variance, training error, test error, and Bayes (or irreducible) error curves, on a single plot, as we go from less flexible statistical learning methods towards more flexible approaches. The x-axis should represent the amount of flexibility in the method, and the y-axis should represent the values for each curve. There should be five curves. Make sure to label each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - See the following code below\n",
    "\n",
    "   __(b)__ Explain why each of the five curves has the shape displayed in part (a).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Squared bias.** This is the error in our model introduced by the difference of our approximation and the true underlying function. A more flexible model will be increasingly similar, and the squared bias therefore dimishes as the flexibility increases. (It might even reach zero if for example the underlying function is a polynomial and by increasing the flexibility at a certain point we include the polynomials of this degree in our hypothesis space.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Variance.** In the limit of a model with no flexibility the variance will be zero, since the model fit will be independent of the data. As the flexibility increases the variance will increase as well since the noise in a particular training set will correspondingly captured by the model. The curve described by the variance is an monotonically increasing function of the flexibility of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Training error.** The training error is given by the average (squared) difference between the predictions of the model and the observations. If a model if very unflexible this can be quite high, but as the flexibility increases this difference will decrease. If we consider polynomials for example increasing the flexibility of the model might mean increasing the degree of the polynomial to be fitted. The additional degrees of freedom will decrease the average difference and reduce the training error.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Test error.** Ths expected test error is given by the formula: Variance + Bias + Bayes error, all of which are non-negative. The Bayes error is constant and a lower bound for the test error. The test error has a minimum at an intermediate level of flexibility: not too flexible, so that the variance does not dominate, and not too unflexible, so that the squared bias is not too high. The plot of the test error thus resembles sort of an upward (deformed) parabola: high for unflexible models, decreasing as flexibility increases until it reaches a minimum. Then the variance starts to dominate and the test error starts increasing. The distance between this minimum and the Bayes irreducible error gives us an idea of how well the best function in the hypothesis space will fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Bayes error**. This term is constant since by definition it does not depend on X and therefore on the flexibility of the model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    - Summarised: Var $(E)$ is the irreducible error and the test predictions cannot be better than this, therefore it is a straight line. Test _MSE_ reduces to an optimum point as increased flexibility means a better fit, with further increases leading to overfitting. Training _MSE_ continues to reduce as more flexibility means the method can very closely fit the training data. Variance increases as the method tends to overfit as flexibility increases (fitting training data too well and not generalizing to test data). Generally, _bias_ is reduced as the flexibility increases due to the method being better able to fit the data. \n"

    "4. You will now think of some real-life applications for statistical learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "   __(a)__ Describe three real-life applications in which classification might be useful. Describe the response, as well as the predictors. Is the goal of each application inference or prediction? Explain your answer.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - **Spam filters.** Any self-respecting email service has a good spam filter: ideally it keeps any undesired email away from your inbox, and let's through every email you're interested in. The response has just two categories: 'spam' or 'not spam', and the predictors can include several different variables: whether you have corresponded with the sender, whether you have their email address in some of your non-spam emails, the words and sequences of words of the emails (for example, if the email includes any reference to a 'Nigerian prince'), whether similar emails have already been tagged as spam by other users, etc. The main goal is prediction because the most important task is to accurately be able to predict whether a future email message is spam or not-spam. An important aspect in this case is the rate of false positives and false negatives. In the case of email it is usually much more acceptable to have false negatives (spam that got through to your inbox) than false positives (important email that was classified as spam and you have never noticed).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Digit recognition.** (or text or speech or facial recognition) An important task required everyday around the world is the recognition of handwritten digits and addresses for postal service or document scanning and OCR (Optical Character Recognition). Depending on how we define the learning task, the predictors can be the original digital photographs or scans of the documents, or just a cropped, grayscale image of a single digit (that is, a $N$ by $M$ matrix of real numbers, each describing the gray scale value of a single pixel). The response might be one of ten digits ($0$ to $9$) or it might include commas and the full numbers (not just the digits), depending on how we decide to define the task. Again here the main goal is prediction, since the most important thing is to recognize a correct address or bank account number from a letter or document.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Social analysis.** Classify people into supporters of Sporting, supporters of Benfica, neither or both (so the response is one of these four categories). As predictors, include factors such as age, nationality, address, income, education, gender, whether they appreciate classical music, their criminal record, etc. Here the main goal is inference, since more than predicting whether someone supports a specific club we are interested in understanding and studying the different factors and discovering interesting relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Other examples:** fraud detection, medical diagnosis, stock prediction (buy, sell, hold), astronomical objects classification, choosing strawberries or cucumbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "    __(b)__ Describe three real-life applications in which regression might be useful. Describe the response, as well as the predictors. Is the goal of each application inference or prediction? Explain your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **House price factors:** Given a set of predictors such as location, house features, median income for the area and so on and the house price as the response/target, we can train a model to infer the impact of those variables on house prices. \n",
    "  \n",
    "    - **Salary:** Predict the salary of an individual given their education, work history, skillsets and other relevant data (age, sex, etc.). The response is the salary amount. \n",
    "  \n",
    "    - **Sales:** Predict unit sales of a product given marketing data such as TV, Radio or Internet advert expenditure, and use it to infer the importance of each advertising method. The response is the unit sales of the product.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    - **Driving Insurance premium:** Given a set of variables such as the drivers history, age, type of vehicle, expected yearly mileage and the premium as the response, we can train a model to predict the insurance premium for new customers. \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "   __(c)__ Describe three real-life applications in which cluster analysis might be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Outlier detection.** If you can define a distance between the data points or a density function in the predictors space, you can use cluster analysis to identify candidate outliers such as the data points farther from the majority of the points, or those in sparser regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Market research.** Using cluster analysis, market researchers can group consumers into market segments according to their similarities. This can provide a better understanding on group characteristics, as well as it can provide useful insights about how different groups of consumers/potential customer behave and relate with different groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Recommender systems.** Will you think watching 'Pulp Fiction' is time well spent? If enough is known about you, including some of your film preferences (and perhaps how many times you have watched 'Stalker' or 'Pulp Fiction') and some similar data about other people, we can have an indication of whether will you think rewatching 'Pulp Fiction' is worth your time... Are you 'closer' to the people who think the answer is 'No' or to the ones that think 'Yes'?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Other examples:** gene sequencing, data compression, social network analysis, representation learning, topography classification."

    "    This exercise does not ask for a precise definition of parametric and non-parametric methods and that the main text does also not provide one (section 2.1.2) is a sign that this definition is not consensual, and in fact it depends on the context in which it is used in statistics [1]. For our purposes we follow both the main text and Murphy [2] (and a few others [3-6]), for a definition of a parametric and non-parametric model (and by model, this we mean a probability distribution or density, or a regression function). So, for our purposes, a parametric model means two thin gs: (1) strong, explicit assumptions about the form of the model, (2) which is parametrized by a finite, fixed number of parameters that does not change with the amount of data. (Yes, the first part of this definition is vague.) Conversely, a non-parametric model means that, in general, the number of parameters depends on the amount of data and that we try to keep assumptions as weak as possible. 'Non-parametric' is thus an unfortunate name since it does not mean 'no parameters'. On the contrary, they do contain parameters (often many more) but these tend to determine the model complexity rather than the form. The typical examples of a parametric and non-parametric models are linear regression and KNN, respectively. Another good example, is the one from the text and figures 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The advantages of a parametric approach are, in general, that it requires less observations, is faster and more computationally tractable, and more robust (less misguided by noise). The disadvantages are the stronger assumptions that make the model less flexible, perhaps unable to capture the underlying adequately regardless of the amount of training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    There are also other types of models such as semi-parametric models [6], which have two components: a parametric and a non-parametric one. One can also have a non-parametric model by using a parametric model but aditionally adapting the number of parameters as needed (say the degree of the polynomial in a linear regression).\n",

    "(d) A large value of $K$ leads to a smoother decision boundary, as if the non-linearities where averaged out. This happens because $KNN$ uses majority voting and this means less emphasis on individual points. For a large value of $K$, we will likely have a decision boundary which varies very little from point to point, since the result of this majority voting would have to change while for most points this will be a large majority. That is, one of its nearest neighbors changing from one class to the other would still leave the majority voting the same. By contrast, when $K$ is very small, the decision boundary will be better able to capture local non-linearities, because the majority of neighbors can vary significantly from point to point since the are so few neighbors. Accordingly, we would expect the best value of $K$ to be small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine this simple example: a true linear boundary that splits the plane in two semi-planes (classes $A$ and $B$), but with an additional enclave in one of the regions. That is, the true model has a small region of, say, class $A$ inside the class $B$ semi-plane. Would we more likely capture this region for small or large $K$? Say we have $3$ neighboring data points in the class $A$ enclave inside the large class $B$ region with say $50$ points. If $K > 4$, each of the $3$ points in the enclave will be classified as $B$, since they always lose by majority voting (unless $K$ is so large, say $100$, that many of the points from $A$ semi-plane region enter this voting). If, on the other hand, $K < 4$, each of the $3$ class $A$ points inside the enclave will be classified as class $A$, and we will capture this non-linearity of the regions."
