# An Introduction to Statistical Learning

# with Applications in Python
# Notes by Gerardo Crespo Bravo.

# Chapters
# Chapter 2 introduces the basic terminology and concepts behind statistical learning. This chapter also presents the K-nearest neighbor classifier, a very simple method that works surprisingly well on many problems.
# Chapters 3 and 4 cover classical linear methods for regression and classification.
# Chapter 3 reviews linear regression, the fundamental starting point for all regression methods.
# Chapter 4 we discuss two of the most important classical classification methods, logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis.
# Chapter 5 we introduce cross-validation and the bootstrap, which can be used to estimate the accuracy of a number of different methods in order to choose the best one.
# Chapter 6 we consider a host of linear methods, both classical and more modern, which offer potential improvements over standard linear regression. These include stepwise selection, ridge regression, principal components regression, and the lasso.
# Chapter 7 introduces a number of non-linear methods that work well for problems with a single input variable.
# Chapter 8, we investigate tree-based methods, including bagging, boosting, and random forests.
# Chapter 9 discuss support vector machines, a set of approaches for performing both linear and non-linear classification.
# Chapter 10 we cover deep learning, an approach for non-linear regression and classification that has received a lot of attention in recent years.
# Chapter 11 explores survival analysis, a regression approach that is specialized to the setting in which the output variable is censored, i.e. not fully observed.
# Chapter 12, we consider the unsupervised setting in which we have input variables but no output variable. In particular, we present principal components analysis, K-means clustering, and hierarchical clustering.
# Chapter 13 we cover the very important topic of multiple hypothesis testing.
