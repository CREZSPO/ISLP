## ðŸ§  Chapters Summary  

### Chapter 2 â€“ *Statistical Learning Basics*  
Introduces the core terminology and concepts of statistical learning. Includes the **K-Nearest Neighbors** classifier â€” a simple yet effective method for many real-world problems.

### Chapter 3 â€“ *Linear Regression*  
Covers the fundamentals of linear regression, forming the basis for many regression techniques.

### Chapter 4 â€“ *Classification Methods*  
Explores **logistic regression** and **linear discriminant analysis**, two essential techniques in classical classification.

### Chapter 5 â€“ *Model Assessment*  
Introduces **cross-validation** and the **bootstrap**, key tools for evaluating and comparing model performance.

### Chapter 6 â€“ *Advanced Linear Models*  
Discusses modern linear modeling techniques including:  
- **Stepwise selection**  
- **Ridge regression**  
- **Lasso**  
- **Principal Components Regression**

### Chapter 7 â€“ *Non-linear Models (1D)*  
Presents non-linear approaches for modeling problems with a single predictor.

### Chapter 8 â€“ *Tree-Based Methods*  
Covers powerful ensemble methods such as:  
- **Decision Trees**  
- **Bagging**  
- **Boosting**  
- **Random Forests**

### Chapter 9 â€“ *Support Vector Machines*  
Explores **SVMs** for both linear and non-linear classification problems.

### Chapter 10 â€“ *Deep Learning*  
Introduces **deep neural networks**, a modern and flexible approach to non-linear regression and classification.

### Chapter 11 â€“ *Survival Analysis*  
Focuses on regression techniques for censored data, where the response variable may be partially observed.

### Chapter 12 â€“ *Unsupervised Learning*  
Covers methods for data without labeled outcomes, including:  
- **Principal Components Analysis (PCA)**  
- **K-Means Clustering**  
- **Hierarchical Clustering**

### Chapter 13 â€“ *Multiple Hypothesis Testing*  
Examines strategies for testing multiple hypotheses, a key concern in modern data analysis.
